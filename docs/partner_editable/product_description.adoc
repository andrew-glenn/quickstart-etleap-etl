Etleap ETL is an extract, transform, load, and transform (ETLT) service for building data warehouses with Amazon Redshift and data lakes with Amazon S3 and AWS Glue.

* Extract from any source, including databases, applications, files, and event streams. Even legacy on-prem sources can be integrated with no extra effort.
* Transform and preview your data using Etleapâ€™s interactive data wrangler, without writing any code. Transformations are run at scale on an auto-scaling Amazon EMR cluster included with this Quick Start.
* Load into an Amazon Redshift data warehouse or an Amazon S3 / AWS Glue data lake for immediate analysis, on-demand access, and long-term archival.
* Model your data with SQL queries for unification and performance, and let Etleap maintain dependencies and orchestration.
* Operate your pipelines without headaches. Automatic detection and guided resolution of schema changes and performance issues keeps your data repository available, reliable, and fast.
